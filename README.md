## Sudoku HTML
This is a simple HTML-based Sudoku game, with its logic written in JavaScript. The JavaScript code derives a lot from my Python Sudoku generator.

##### Features:
+ 4 difficulty levels (**Normal** being the default one)
+ A *Check* button, which can check your progress on the go, without having to complete the entire puzzle first.
     Especially useful if your playstyle emphasizes little steps!
+ A timer, to check how much time it took you to complete the puzzle!
+ A *Reset* button, in case things go too wrong for you to find the mistake!

I hope you enjoy this little game!
